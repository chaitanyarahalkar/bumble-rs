# bumble-rs

An incremental Rust port of [`google/bumble`](https://github.com/google/bumble),
the Python Bluetooth stack.

Bumble is a ~70,000-line dual-mode Bluetooth host stack plus a software
controller. A full port is a large, multi-slice effort. This repository ports
it **one vertical slice at a time**, each slice a compiling, fully-tested Rust
crate whose behavior is verified against the upstream Python.

## Status

| Slice | Crate | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1. Core types & advertising data | `bumble` | ✅ complete — 16/16 tests green |
| 2. HCI packet codec (framing + commands + events + return params) | `bumble-hci` | ✅ 43/43 tests green |
| 3+7. Software controller + virtual link (advertising + LE connections) | `bumble-controller` | ✅ 6/6 tests green |
| 4. L2CAP frame codec (PDU + signaling frames + FCS) | `bumble-l2cap` | ✅ 8/8 tests green |
| 5. ATT protocol PDU codec | `bumble-att` | ✅ 8/8 tests green |
| 6. SMP cryptographic toolbox | `bumble-crypto` | ✅ 10/10 vectors green |
| 7. LE connection establishment (in the controller) | `bumble-controller` | ✅ (see slice 3+7) |
| 8. ACL data path (ATT-over-L2CAP-over-ACL, cross-layer) | `bumble-controller` | ✅ 8/8 controller tests |
| 9+. GATT client/server → profiles | — | planned |

Slice 2 covers the HCI **framing foundation**, every command exercised by
`hci_test.py::run_test_commands` (fixed-layout, address, mask, and the per-entry
array commands like Extended_Create_Connection), the generic command/event
fallbacks, the LE events (Command_Status, Number_Of_Completed_Packets, four LE
meta events, and both Advertising Report events), and **Command_Complete with a
typed return-parameters model** (LE_Read_Buffer_Size, Read_BD_ADDR,
Read_Local_Name, Read_Local_Supported_Codecs + V2, and the status-based
short-response fallback). Of `hci_test.py`'s ~46 tests, 42 are ported. The
remaining 4 are the vendor-event factory (a runtime-registration pattern) and
three parametrized tests that iterate Python's class registry — neither has an
analog in an enum-based port, so they're intentionally out of scope.

## Slice 1 — what's here

The shared primitives every higher Bluetooth layer depends on, ported to
idiomatic Rust in the [`bumble`](bumble/) crate (std-only, no dependencies):

- **`Uuid`** — 16/32/128-bit UUIDs, little-endian storage, big-endian strings,
  128-bit-expansion equality & hashing.
- **`Address` / `AddressType`** — little-endian device addresses, string parsing
  (`"C4:F2:17:1A:1D:BB"`, `/P` suffix), and the resolvable/static/identity
  predicates.
- **`Appearance`** — GAP appearance encode/decode with open-enum semantics.
- **`ClassOfDevice`** — Class of Device packing and string rendering.
- **`AdvertisingData`** — raw TLV codec (`append`/`get`/`get_all`/`to_bytes`).

### Design notes

- **Open enums.** `AddressType`, appearance `Category`/subcategory,
  `AdvertisingData::Type`, and the Class-of-Device fields are newtypes over
  integers, so values outside the named set round-trip unchanged — matching
  Bumble's `OpenIntEnum`/`CompatibleIntFlag`.
- **Byte- and string-exact.** Encodings and formatted strings match Bumble
  exactly; verified by a differential check against the Python implementation.
- **Deferred** (no upstream test exercises them): the `company_ids` table, the
  typed `data_types` value hierarchy, and crypto-based address generation.

## Slice 2 — what's here

The HCI packet codec in the [`bumble-hci`](bumble-hci/) crate (depends on
`bumble` for `Address`):

- **`HciPacket`** — top-level dispatch on the packet type byte.
- **`Command`** — 22 typed commands (Reset, Disconnect, PIN_Code_Request_Reply,
  Set/LE_Set_Event_Mask, LE_Set_Random_Address, LE advertising/scan/connection
  commands including the per-PHY array forms Extended_Create_Connection /
  Set_Extended_Scan_Parameters / Set_Extended_Advertising_Enable,
  LE_Setup_ISO_Data_Path, and the Read_Local_* commands), plus a `Generic`
  fallback.
- **`Event` / `LeMetaEvent`** — Command_Complete, Command_Status,
  Number_Of_Completed_Packets, the LE Connection_Complete /
  Connection_Update_Complete / Channel_Selection_Algorithm /
  Read_Remote_Features_Complete meta events, and both LE Advertising Report
  events (nested per-report structs), plus `Generic` fallbacks.
- **`ReturnParameters`** — typed Command_Complete return parameters
  (LE_Read_Buffer_Size, Read_BD_ADDR, Read_Local_Name,
  Read_Local_Supported_Codecs + V2) with the status-based short-response
  fallback, plus a `Raw` fallback.
- **Data packets** — ACL, Synchronous (SCO), ISO (with the timestamp / SDU-info
  blocks), and the custom passthrough packet.

### Design notes

- **Enum dispatch with a `Generic` fallback.** Each typed variant decodes its
  fields; unrecognized op/event codes round-trip as raw bytes.
- **Oracle-verified.** Every acceptance test asserts the serialized bytes
  against a ground-truth hex literal captured from real Python Bumble
  (`bytes(x).hex()`). This is the load-bearing correctness check — a pure
  round-trip would pass on a symmetric-but-wrong layout (and in fact the oracle
  caught exactly such a bug in `Number_Of_Completed_Packets`).

## Slice 3 — what's here

A minimal software controller and an in-process link in the
[`bumble-controller`](bumble-controller/) crate — the first slice where two
virtual devices actually talk:

- **`Controller`** — LE state driven by HCI commands (`Reset`,
  `LE_Set_Random_Address`, `LE_Set_Advertising_Data`, `LE_Set_Advertising_Enable`,
  `LE_Set_Scan_Enable`), producing Command Complete acks and, when scanning,
  LE Advertising Report events.
- **`LocalLink`** — an in-process bus that broadcasts an advertiser's PDU to
  scanning controllers, and (slice 7) establishes LE connections: an initiating
  central (`LE_Create_Connection`) plus a connectable advertiser produce an
  `LE_Connection_Complete` on both hosts (central role / peripheral role, each
  seeing the other's address), and the advertiser stops.

### Design notes

- **Synchronous link.** Bumble's `LocalLink` schedules delivery on an asyncio
  loop; this slice models it synchronously (`propagate_advertising` delivers
  PDUs when called, and host events are drained from a queue) — deterministic
  and dependency-free, with the same packet flow, only the real-time scheduling
  dropped.
- **End-to-end.** The acceptance test wires two controllers to a link: one
  advertises, the other scans, and the scanner's host receives an Advertising
  Report carrying the advertiser's address and data — which then round-trips
  through the `bumble-hci` codec.
- **ACL data path (slice 8).** Once connected, `LocalLink::send_acl_data` routes
  a host's ACL payload to the peer host on its own connection handle. The
  controller treats the payload as opaque bytes — the integration test builds an
  **ATT PDU → L2CAP PDU → ACL** on the sender and parses it back up the stack on
  the receiver, composing four crates (`bumble-controller`, `bumble-hci`,
  `bumble-l2cap`, `bumble-att`) into one end-to-end flow.
- **Deferred:** LL control PDUs, disconnection, extended advertising sets,
  CIS/ISO, encryption, and classic/LMP.

## Slice 4 — what's here

The L2CAP frame codec in the [`bumble-l2cap`](bumble-l2cap/) crate (std-only —
the frame format is independent of HCI and addresses):

- **`L2capPdu`** — the L2CAP data-packet frame with an optional Frame Check
  Sequence (`crc_16`, CRC-16-IBM), verified against Bumble's FCS test vectors.
- **`serialize_psm` / `parse_psm`** — the variable-length Protocol/Service
  Multiplexer encoding.
- **`ControlFrame`** — signaling frames: Connection_Request and the four
  credit-based frames (Connection Request/Response, Reconfigure
  Request/Response), plus a `Generic` fallback for other signaling codes.

Deferred: the full signaling command set, configuration options,
enhanced-retransmission control fields, and the channel manager / reassembly.

## Slice 5 — what's here

The ATT (Attribute Protocol) PDU codec in the [`bumble-att`](bumble-att/) crate
(depends on `bumble` for `Uuid`):

- **`AttPdu`** — `[op_code, payload…]` framing with typed variants:
  Error_Response, Exchange_MTU_Request/Response, Read_Request/Response,
  Read_By_Group_Type_Request (UUID group type), Write_Request/Response,
  Handle_Value_Notification, plus a `Generic` fallback and the `is_command` /
  `is_signed` op-code bit helpers.

Deferred: the remaining ATT PDUs (Find_Information, grouped
Read_By_Type_Response, prepared/queued and signed writes, indications) and the
GATT client/server layers.

## Slice 6 — what's here

The SMP cryptographic toolbox in the [`bumble-crypto`](bumble-crypto/) crate
(Vol 3, Part H - 2.2), on top of the audited `aes` crate:

- **`e`** — the AES block security function (byte-swapped I/O).
- **`aes_cmac`** — RFC 4493 AES-CMAC, hand-implemented (subkey generation +
  padding) over AES-128.
- **`c1` / `s1` / `ah`** — LE Legacy confirm/key/hash functions.
- **`f4` / `f5` / `f6` / `g2` / `h6` / `h7`** — LE Secure Connections
  confirm/key/check/numeric-comparison and link-key conversion functions.

Every function is pinned to the published Bluetooth-spec and RFC 4493 test
vectors — the strongest correctness check in the whole port. ECC P-256 key
agreement and RNG are out of scope for this slice.

## Acceptance

The port's contract is the upstream Python test suite, ported 1:1:

| Rust test | Upstream source |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `test_ad_data` | `tests/core_test.py` |
| `test_get_dict_key_by_value` | `tests/core_test.py` |
| `test_uuid_to_hex_str` | `tests/core_test.py` |
| `test_uuid_hash` | `tests/core_test.py` |
| `test_appearance` | `tests/core_test.py` |
| `test_class_of_device` | `tests/core_test.py` |
| `test_address` | `tests/hci_test.py` |

These live in [`bumble/tests/acceptance.rs`](bumble/tests/acceptance.rs); the
same behaviors are also covered by inline unit tests in each module.

Slice 2's 42 HCI tests live in
[`bumble-hci/tests/acceptance.rs`](bumble-hci/tests/acceptance.rs), each ported
from a `tests/hci_test.py` case and pinned to Python-oracle bytes.
